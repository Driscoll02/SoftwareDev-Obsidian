A virtual environment in Python is nothing more than a directory (folder). It is most common to create the virtual environment inside your project folder alongside all your source code.

## Command list:

Create env:
```python -m venv <env name (commonly just env)>```

Start env:
```env\Scripts\activate.bat```

Exit/Stop env:
```deactivate```

## Installing packages

To install packages in your environment the most common package manager used is pip. More information can be found here: [[Installing Packages (pip)]]
