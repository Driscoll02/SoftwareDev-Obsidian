There are 4 main areas of machine learning to be aware of:

-  Supervised learning ([[Supervised Learning]])
-  Unsupervised learning ([[Unsupervised Learning]])
-  Reinforcement learning ([[Reinforcement Learning]])
-  Generative AI ([[Generative AI]])

There are also notes here on important concepts such as:
