This is the main index for notes on vector embeddings. Below are links to different topics covered in the workspace:

- [[Embedding Benchmarks]]: An explanation of different benchmark setups and their results.
- [[Cosine vs Euclidean]]: When we should use Cosine sim vs Euclidean distance.
- [[SBERT vs Gemini Embeddings]]: Why Gemini embeddings seem to outperform SBERT models.
- Improving SBERT performance: Ways we can improve SBERT embedding models.
