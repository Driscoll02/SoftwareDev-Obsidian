Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where a model is trained on a labelled dataset of correct information. 

The model can then use that information to find connections between elements which provide correct answers.

For example, we could have a dataset containing a range of emails, with a label to indicate whether that email was spam or not. The job of a the supervised learning model would be to look at that data and find connections between the content of the email and the output label of either 'spam' or 'not spam'.

The aim is to have a model which can look at an entirely new email it has never seen before, and be able to accurately label it as spam or not spam.

The example given was something known as a classification problem. Generally within supervised learning we have two main types of models:

-  Regression models
-  Classification models

## Regression models

Regression models are used to predict a single numerical value. More information on regression models can be found here: [[Regression Models]]

## Classification models

Classification models are used to predict the likelihood that something fits into a category. This is the kind of model our spam email detection model was from before. More information on classification models can be found here: [[Classification Models]]
