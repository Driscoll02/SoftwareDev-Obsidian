A content management system (CMS) is a tool which allows users to build and manage websites without needing to build it from scratch, or without having to know how to code.

CMS's provide ways of creating, managing, modifying, and publishing content through a user friendly interface.

A traditional CMS is made up of 2 main components:

-  Content management application (CMA)
-  Content delivery application (CDA)

When combined, these tools provide enough functionality to cover [[Back-End]] features such as database queries.

## Headless CMS

Whilst traditional CMS's provide functionality for both the front and backend of a website, headless CMS's are used only for the backend.

Headless CMS's are useful when you have a team of front end developers who can build out functionality in their chosen framework.

The CMS can then be accessed via API requests to display data on the frontend. 

The benefit to having a headless CMS is that users who don't have the technical skills to build a backend can add new content to their site, for the front end developers to display nicely on the frontend.
